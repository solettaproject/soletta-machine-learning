= Soletta Machine Learning =

Soletta Machine Learning is an open source machine learning library
for development of IoT devices.
It provides APIs to handle with client side AI and an easy to use flow-based
Soletta module.

Initially supporting neural networks and fuzzy logic learning,
using well established open source libraries, it could be easily
extended to support others.

= Building =

== Dependencies ==

This project depends on:

fuzzylite:
    Desc: A fuzzy logic control library written in C++.
    Site: http://www.fuzzylite.com/
    Source: https://github.com/fuzzylite/fuzzylite.git

FANN (Fast Artificial Neural Network Library):
    Desc: An open source neural network library.
    Site: http://leenissen.dk/fann/wp/
    Source: https://github.com/libfann/fann

Soletta:
    Desc: Soletta Project is a framework for making IoT devices.
    Site: https://solettaproject.org/
    Source: https://github.com/solettaproject/soletta

Some distros (like Fedora, Ubuntu), has packaged FANN and fuzzylite.

== Linux ==

 * Build and install all dependencies
 * At the moment, it's required to do a minor fix on fuzzylite/fuzzylite.pc.in:
    Replace

    Cflags: -I${includedir}/fl

    by

    Cflags: -I${includedir}

    Alternativelly it's possible to provide a cmake with extra cflags:
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="-I/path/to/proper/header/dir/"


 * After dependencies setup and installation, build machine-learning running:
 ** Using both engines

    $ cmake -DFUZZY_ENGINE=ON -DANN_ENGINE=ON .

    or

    $ cmake .
    $ make

 ** Using only the neural networks engine
    $ cmake -DFUZZY_ENGINE=OFF .
    $ make


 ** Using only the Fuzzy engine
    $ cmake -DANN_ENGINE=OFF .
    $ make

== Docs ==
* To build docs run:
    $ make doc

== Galileo ==
 * Install proper toolchain to build for galileo board.
 * Edit soletta_module/i586-poky-linux-uclibc.cmake and update
   CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH variable to point the toolchain's sysdir with any
   necessary dependencies to build sml.
 * Create temporary directory to install sml and its dependencies. It is
   called in this instruction {TMP_DESTDIR_PATH}
 * To use soletta_module/i586-poky-linux-uclibc.cmake to build fann and
   fuzzylite and install them to the toolchain's ROOT_PATH. Run:
   $ cmake ..   -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE={PATH_TO_SML}soletta_module/i586-poky-linux-uclibc.cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr
   $ make && make install DESTDIR={TMP_DESTDIR_PATH}
 * Copy all files in {TMP_DESTDIR_PATH} to toolchain's sysdir.
 * Use same command to build sml and to install it to {TMP_DESTDIR_PATH}
 * Copy all files in {TMP_DESTDIR_PATH} to root of image to be used in galileo
   board.
