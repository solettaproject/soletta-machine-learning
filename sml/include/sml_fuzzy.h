 *
 * If ::sml_process is called and a variable has no terms fuzzy engine will
 * automatically create terms for this variable. Some properties are important
 * help fuzzy engine to improve the quality of the created terms.
 *
 * Width is the width of each creted term. Other important properties are
 * is_id, set by ::sml_fuzzy_variable_set_is_id and range (min and max), set by
 * ::sml_variable_set_range.
 *
 * For example, for the variable created by the following code:
 * @code{.c}
 * struct sml_variable *var = sml_new_input(sml, "my_var");
 * sml_variable_set_range(sml, var, 0, 5);
 * sml_fuzzy_variable_set_default_term_width(sml, var, 1);
 * @endcode
 *
 * Fuzzy engine will create 5 terms:
 * - ramp from 0 to 1
 * - triangle from 1 to 2, with peak at 0.5
 * - triangle from 2 to 3, with peak at 1.5
 * - triangle from 3 to 4, with peak at 3.5
 * - ramp from 4 to 5.
 *
 * After that, a small overlap will be added between each term. The default
 * overlap value is 10% of width, in this case, 0.1. So at the end we would
 * have:
 * - ramp from 0 to 1.1
 * - triangle from 0.9 to 2.1, with peak at 0.5
 * - triangle from 1.9 to 3.1, with peak at 1.5
 * - triangle from 2.9 to 4.1, with peak at 3.5
 * - ramp from 3.9 to 5.
 *
 * In case the variable is an id, the first and last element will have a size
 * width/2. This is necessary so we can have a constant distance from the peak
 * of each term. This distance is always equal width.
 *
 * For example, for the variable created by the following code:
 * @code{.c}
 * struct sml_variable *var = sml_new_input(sml, "my_var");
 * sml_variable_set_range(sml, var, 0, 5);
 * sml_fuzzy_variable_set_default_term_width(sml, var, 1);
 * sml_fuzzy_variable_set_is_id(sml, var, true);
 * @endcode
 * We would have 5 terms:
 * - ramp from 0 to 0.6
 * - triangle from 0.4 to 1.6, with peak at 1
 * - triangle from 1.4 to 2.6 with peak at 2
 * - triangle from 2.4 to 3.6, with peak at 3
 * - triange from 3.4 to 4.6, with peak at 4
 * - ramp from 4.4 to 5
 *
 * Terms autocreated are also rebalanced everytime ::sml_variable_set_range is
 * called. So new terms are created to make sure all variable range is covered.
 * And terms that are no longer necessary are removed.
