 * @brief The SML neural network engine.
 *
 * \anchor Neural_Network_Engine_Introduction
 *
 * A neural network consists in a set of neurons that are inter-connected
 * and distributed in layers, usually three (Input, hidden and output layers).
 * For every connection between neurons there is a weight associated to it,
 * these weights are initialized randomly with values between -0.2 and 0.2 and
 * adjusted during the training phase, so the neural network
 * output predict the right value.
 *
 * The neuron is the basic unit of the neural network and it's responsible for
 * producing an output value based on its inputs, the output is calculated
 * using the following formula:
 * <br> <center> \f$ f(\sum_{i=1}^{n} W_i * I_i) = Out (1)\f$ </center>
 * Where:
 * <ul>
 *    <li>\f$i\f$ is the index of the input.
 *    <li>\f$n\f$ is the number of inputs.
 *    <li>\f$I_i\f$ is the input value for input i.
 *    <li>\f$W_i\f$ is the weight value for the input i.
 *    <li>\f$Out\f$ is the output value.
 *    <li>\f$f(x)\f$ is the activation function.
 * </ul>
 *
 * The activation function is chosen by the user and it can be any differentiable function,
 * however most problems can be solved using the Sigmoid function.
 *
 * As an example, imagine that one wants to predict if a light should be on/off if Bob and Alice
 * is present in the room using the following trained neural network.
 * @image html ann.png
 *
 * Consider that Bob is present (input is 1) and Alice (input is 0) is not.
 *
 * The first step is to provide the Bob's and Alice's presence to the input neurons,
 * In a neuron network the input neurons are special, because they do not apply the formula (1) to produce an output.
 * The output value from a input neuron is the input value itself, so in this case the
 * N1 and N2 neurons will output 1 and 0 respectively.
 *
 * Consider that all neurons are using the sigmoid function defined as:
 * <br><center>\f$\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\f$</center>
 *
 * Using the formula (1) the N3's output will be:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *     OutputN3 &=& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\
 *              &=& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-((1 * 3) + (0 * 1.2))}}\\
 *              &=& 0.95
 * \f}
 *
 * The same thing for N4:
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *     OutputN4 &=& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\
 *              &=& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-((1 * 3.4) + (0 * 2.5))}}\\
 *              &=& 0.96
 * \f}
 *
 * Finally the Light state (N5):
 * \f{eqnarray*}{
 *     Light state  &=& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}\\
 *              &=& \frac{1}{1 + e^{-((0.95 * 4) + (0.96 * 5))}}\\
 *              &=& 0.99
 * \f}
 *
 * The neural network predict that the light state is 0.99, as it's very close to 1 we can consider
 * that the light should be On.
 *
 * @remark The values used in the neural network above
 * (inputs, outputs, neuron weights) were chosen randomly.
 *
 * The example above uses two neurons in the hidden layer, however for some problem, two neurons is not good enough.
 * There is no silver bullet about how many neurons one should use in the hidden layer, this number is obtained by trial and error.
 * SML can handle this automatically, during the training phase SML will automatically choose the neural network topology
 * (how many neurons the hidden layer must have), it will also decide which is the best activation function.
 *
 * The SML neural network engine has two methods of operation, these methods try
 * to reduce or eliminate a problem called catastrophic forgetting that affects neural
 * networks.
 *
 * Basically catastrophic forgetting is a problem that the neural network may forget everything
 * that has learnt in the past and only accumulate recent memory. This happens due the nature
 * of their training. In order to reduce this problem the following methods were implemented.
 *
 * The first method is called pseudo-rehearsal (the default one), in this method only one neural network is created
 * and everytime it needs be retrained, random inputs are generated and
 * feed to the network. The corresponding outputs are stored and used to train the neural network
 * with the new collected data.
 *
 * The second method of operation consists in creating N neural networks,
 * that are very specific for each pattern that SML encounters and everytime the SML wants to make a prediction,
 * it will choose which is the best neural network for the current situation.
 * It is possible to set a limit of how many neural networks SML will have in memory, this limit
 * can be set with ::sml_ann_set_cache_max_size. This cache implements the LRU algorithm so,
 * neural networks that were not recent used will be deleted.
