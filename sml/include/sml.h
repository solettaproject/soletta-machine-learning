 *
 * Soletta Machine Learning (SML) is an open source machine learning library
 * focused on development of IoT projects.
 *
 * It provides API to handle with client side AI and an easy to use
 * flow-based Soletta module. Supports neural networks and fuzzy logic
 * learning and can be easily extended to support others.
 *
 * SML is divided in the following groups:
 *
 * @li @ref Engine
 * @li @ref Fuzzy_Engine
 * @li @ref Log
 * @li @ref Mainloop
 * @li @ref Ann_Engine
 * @li @ref Variables

/**
 * @file
 * @defgroup Engine Engine
 * @brief The SML common functions.
 *
 * The functions here are common to all engines.
 * They are used to free the engines,
 * create variables, save/load SML state and more.
 *
 * The SML main flow consist in the following steps:
 * - Choose an engine (ANN or Fuzzy).
 * - Create the inputs and outputs variables.
 * - Register the read callback.
 * - Register the change callback.
 * - Read the variable value, set it in SML and call process.
 *
 * As a simple example imagine that one wants to control an indoor light that
 * turns on automatically if a person enters in the room and goes off if
 * the person leaves. For that, this person has a presence sensor.
 *
 * Choosing engines and creating variables is straight-forward after
 * the solution is modeled. Let's say fuzzy was the choosen one.
 * Registering callbacks is simple as well:
 *
 * @dontinclude example_doc.c
 * @skip main
 * @until sml_set_output_state_changed_callback
 *
 * Terms are a way to split the values in the range in meaningful parts.
 * Fuzzy supports some functions to describe them, as ramps, triangles
 * and others.
 *
 * Although we have the possibility to define each term to describe your
 * problem, for this example we will let the fuzzy engine do this for you.
 * To improve the quality of the automatically created terms, we need to give
 * fuzzy engine some hints about the variable being used. As both variables are
 * boolean values, lets set the default term width to 0.5 and the range from
 * 0 to 1. So we will have 2 terms, one for on and another for off.
 *
 * After everything is set up, it's time to trigger the processing.
 * It will be done in a simple loop, making 150 sml_process() calls,
 * but more elaborated ways to call process() can be implemented,
 * using mainloops.
 *
 * @until }
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * Read and change callbacks implementation varies a lot depending
 * on machine learning usage, since they're the interface with the
 * rest of the world.
 *
 * Read callback is a function that will be called at each processing cycle
 * to update variables values.
 *
 * So in this function the values of presence sensor and light must
 * to be fetched. It could be done via GPIO, OIC, or any other way,
 * depending in your product. It may be synchronous or asynchronous.
 *
 * To keep it simple, yet illustrative, we're going to simulate the values
 * in a function read_state_cb() Variable sensor_state represents presense
 * sensor reading, switch_state represents light state.
 *
 * This variable will be global since its going to be used by the callback
 * of state changes (you could use a struct with this variable and pass them
 * to callbacks).
 *
 * To simulate a daily based used, a day would be a cycle of 15 readings,
 * user will be present on last 5 readings of each "day".
 * When she leaves she remembers to turn lights off... most of the time.
 * This is simulated by off_count . When she forgets lights on and leaves,
 * machine learning should suggest to turn lights off.
 *
 * After states are "fetch", they're set on sml variables (input and output).
 *
 * @dontinclude example_doc.c
 * @skip static int switch_state
 * @until return true;
 * @until }
 *
 * To fetch predicted output values, it's required to set a
 * callback function using sml_set_output_state_changed_callback()
 *
 * This callback will be called when SML makes a prediction for at
 * least one output variable.
 *
 * Change state callback only will be called on output value changes.
 * But most of the time, this prediction should matches current state of
 * output variable. On this case no action must to be taken.
 * Also, sometimes SML doesn't have enough information to make a prediction,
 * setting output variable value to NaN.
 *
 * So in change state callback we're going to check first if it was able
 * to predict a value, then check if we need to act, in case prediction
 * and current light state diverges.
 *
 * In this example we'll just print a message informing the light state
 * should be changed.
 *
 * @skip static void
 * @until printf("Light should be turned OFF.\n");
 * @until }
 * @until }
 *
 * A few tips to obtain good predictions.
 *  - Do not try to control the whole world with one SML object.
 *  - If you want to control a light and an air-conditioning and they
 *    are independent of each other. Create two SML objects,
 *    one will control the light and another one the air-conditioning.
 *  - Try to avoid adding unnecessary inputs/outpus to SML (or forget
 *    to add relevant inputs/outputs), this may lead the poor
 *    predictions.
 *  - Test both engines and check which one has the best results
 *    for your problem.
